**Project Goal:**

Seamlessly integrate Civet (`<script lang="civet">`) into Svelte components, providing accurate and reliable source mapping for all language features (hover, go-to-definition, debugging, error reporting) back to the original `.svelte` file, specifically the Civet code within it. The integration should feel native to Svelte tooling.

**Current Pipeline Overview:**

1.  **`civetPreprocessor.ts` (`preprocessCivet` function):**
    *   Identifies `<script lang="civet">` blocks in a `.svelte` file.
    *   Extracts, trims, and dedents the Civet code snippet.
    *   Calls `compileCivet` to transpile the Civet snippet to TypeScript and get a raw "lines" sourcemap (Civet snippet -> TS snippet).
    *   Calculates the original line offset of the Civet snippet within the `.svelte` file.
    *   Calls `normalizeCivetMap` to convert the raw Civet "lines" map into a standard V3 sourcemap. This map (`normalizedMap`) correctly maps positions from the Civet-generated TS snippet *back to their original positions within the full `.svelte` file's Civet block*.
    *   Replaces the Civet code in the `.svelte` file content with the transpiled TypeScript.
    *   The output is a modified Svelte content string (with TS instead of Civet) and one or two `CivetBlockInfo` objects (for instance/module scripts) containing the `normalizedMap` and positional metadata.

2.  **`svelte2tsx/index.ts` (`svelte2tsx` function):**
    *   Takes the (potentially preprocessed by `preprocessCivet`) Svelte content.
    *   Generates the final TSX output used by the Svelte Language Server. This involves creating render functions, instance setup, etc.
    *   Generates a "base" sourcemap (`baseMap`) that maps this final TSX output back to the Svelte content it received (which, if preprocessed, now contains TS where Civet used to be).
    *   If Civet blocks were processed, it calls `civetMapChainer.ts` (`chainMaps` function) to attempt to merge/chain the `normalizedMap` (Svelte File -> Civet's TS output) with the `baseMap` (Svelte File w/ TS -> Final TSX).

3.  **`civetMapChainer.ts` (`chainMaps` function):**
    *   **Current Core Task:** Takes `baseMap` (from Svelte content containing TS to final TSX) and the `normalizedMap` (from original Svelte Civet block to Civet's TS output, which is now part of the Svelte content `baseMap` refers to).
    *   **Goal:** Produce a final sourcemap that maps directly from the *final TSX output* back to the *original Civet code within the `.svelte` file*.
    *   **Current Flawed Approach (Simplified):**
        1.  It decodes `baseMap` (TSX -> Svelte-with-TS).
        2.  For each segment in `baseMap` (e.g., TSX_PosA -> Svelte_PosA_with_TS), if Svelte_PosA_with_TS falls within where a Civet block *was*:
            *   It uses a `TraceMap` instance created from the `normalizedMap` (Svelte Civet -> Civet's TS).
            *   It attempts to find what Svelte_PosA_with_TS corresponds to in the `normalizedMap`. The critical error is that it calculates relative line/column coordinates (`relLine`, `relCol`) for `traceSegment` based on the `baseMap`'s Svelte target and the *output position* of the Civet TS in the Svelte-with-TS content.
            *   `traceSegment(tracer_for_normalizedMap, relLine, relCol)` is called. The `tracer_for_normalizedMap` expects Svelte file coordinates.
            *   The result of `traceSegment` (`traced`) contains `traced[2]` (original Svelte line) and `traced[3]` (original Svelte column) *as perceived by `normalizedMap` for the Svelte input `relLine, relCol`*.
            *   `chainMaps` then uses `traced[2]` and `traced[3]` as the *final original Svelte coordinates* for the initial TSX_PosA. This is where the error occurs for `foo1`.

**The Specific `foo1` Hover Bug & Its Root Cause:**

*   **User Report:** Hovering over `foo1` in the first line of a Civet script (`\tfunction foo1()`) in the Svelte file results in the hover information appearing for the `function` keyword instead of `foo1`.
*   **Test Case:** `6 - userReportedHover#current.test.ts` using `twoFooUserRequest.svelte` fixture.
*   **Current State (as per test):** The final sourcemap maps the TSX `foo1` identifier (e.g., at TSX Line 3, Column 9) back to Svelte Line 2, Column 1 (the `f` in `function \tfoo1()`). It *should* map to Svelte Line 2, Column 9 (the `f` in `foo1`).
*   **Root Cause Analysis:**
    1.  `normalizeCivetMap` correctly maps the Civet-generated TS `foo1` back to the Svelte `foo1` (L2C9).
    2.  `svelte2tsx`'s `baseMap` for the TSX `foo1` token coarsely maps it back to the start of the Svelte line `\tfunction foo1()` (i.e., L2C1, the `f` in `function`).
    3.  `chainMaps`, when processing this `baseMap` segment (TSX L3C9 -> Svelte L2C1):
        *   It calls `traceSegment` on the `normalizedMap` with Svelte L2C1.
        *   `normalizedMap` correctly reports that Svelte L2C1 (the `f` in `function`) maps to its Civet-generated TS `function` (col 0). The `traced` result will reflect Svelte L2C1 as the original.
        *   `chainMaps` then incorrectly pushes a new mapping using the TSX L3C9 and this Svelte L2C1 from the `traced` result, effectively solidifying the coarse mapping from `baseMap`. It loses/overwrites the more precise Svelte L2C9 target for `foo1` that `normalizedMap` originally held.

**Key Files for Investigation & Refactor:**

1.  **`packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/utils/civetMapChainer.ts`:** This is the primary location for the fix. The `chainMaps` function needs a new strategy for correctly combining column (and potentially line) information from `baseMap` and `normalizedMap`. It must ensure that the detailed mappings from `normalizedMap` (Svelte Civet -> Civet's TS) are preserved when creating the final TSX -> Svelte Civet map.
2.  **`packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/utils/civetPreprocessor.ts`:** Understand how `normalizedMap` is generated and what information (`CivetBlockInfo`) is passed to `svelte2tsx`/`chainMaps`. Ensure all necessary data for accurate chaining is available.
3.  **`packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts`:** Understand how `svelte2tsx` calls `chainMaps` and what `baseMap` represents at that point.
4.  **`packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/utils/civetMapToV3.ts` (`normalizeCivetMap`):** Confirm its correctness (which current analysis suggests is high) and ensure its output sourcemap (`normalizedMap`) provides unambiguous mappings from Civet's TS back to the original Svelte/Civet code.

**Desired Outcome of the Refactor/New Architecture for `chainMaps`:**

The `chainMaps` function (or its replacement) must achieve the following:
For a given segment in the final TSX output (e.g., the `foo1` identifier):
1.  Use `baseMap` to find its corresponding location in the intermediate Svelte-with-TS content.
2.  If this location falls within a region previously occupied by Civet code (now replaced by Civet's TS output):
    *   Determine the precise location within the Civet-generated TS that corresponds to this point.
    *   Use the `normalizedMap` (Svelte Civet -> Civet's TS) in "reverse" (or by iterating its segments) to find the *original Svelte/Civet location* that `normalizeCivetMap` had for that precise Civet-generated TS location.
    *   This final original Svelte/Civet location should be the target for the TSX segment.

Essentially, the detailed column (and line) information from `normalizeCivetMap` for specific tokens *must* take precedence over potentially coarser mappings from `baseMap` when dealing with code originating from Civet.

This might involve:
*   More granular analysis of the decoded segments of both `baseMap` and `normalizedMap`.
*   A different strategy for iterating or looking up mappings, potentially not relying on `traceSegment` in the current manner if it proves too restrictive for this re-mapping task.
*   Careful handling of line and column offsets at each stage.

This detailed brief should provide a professional developer with the necessary context to understand the problem, the current flawed approach, and the requirements for designing a correct and robust sourcemap chaining solution.
