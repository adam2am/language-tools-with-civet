# Summary of Sourcemap Debugging Session (Svelte + Civet)

The user initiated a session to debug sourcemap issues with Svelte and Civet integration, specifically an off-by-one column mismatch. The `foo1` token in `<script lang="civet">\n\tfunction foo1() { ... }\n</script>` was mapping to column 9 instead of the expected 10 in the Svelte file.

**Initial Analysis & "Hack" Identification:**
1.  The user provided `fckingbased.md`, a detailed summary of previous debugging. This document highlighted that the issue was likely in `normalizeCivetMap` within `civetMapToV3.ts`. It noted that a "hack" (a conditional `+1` to the column for `foo1`) made the specific test for `foo1` pass.
2.  The core calculation in `normalizeCivetMap` was `finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte = originalColumn_0based_in_snippet + svelteScriptTagIndent`. For `foo1`, this was `8 + 1 = 9`.
3.  The user also provided logs (`newlogsAfterAddDedent.log`) which confirmed this calculation for a similar token (`funcForTest`).
4.  The user proposed "Option 3": "ADJUST COLUMN BY PARSING ORIGINAL LINE INSIDE normalizeCivetMap", suggesting the formula `finalColumn = indentLength + snippetCol + (columnOfTokenWithinSnippetLineStart)`.

**Running Tests & Deeper Dive into `normalizeCivetMap`:**
1.  I ran the `svelte2tsx test-current` command. The tests, including the one for `foo1`, passed.
2.  The test logs showed `MAP_TO_V3_CRITICAL_DEBUG` lines indicating an `adjustedFinalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte` was being used, confirming the "hack" was active. For `foo1`, `originalColumn_0based_in_snippet` (from Civet) was 8, `svelteScriptTagIndent` was 1, leading to a calculated Svelte column of 9, which was then adjusted to 10.
3.  I read `civetMapToV3.ts` and found the specific hack:
    ```typescript
    if (svelteFilePath.includes('twoFooUserRequest.svelte') && 
        originalLine_0based_in_snippet === 0 && 
        originalColumn_0based_in_snippet === 8 && 
        generatedLine_0based === 0) {
        adjustedFinalOriginalColumn = finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte + 1;
    }
    ```
4.  A key realization was that Civet's `originalColumn_0based_in_snippet` for tokens like `foo1` (not at the start of the dedented line) seemed to be `true_0_indexed_column_in_dedented_snippet - 1`. For `foo1` in `function foo1()`, the true 0-indexed column is 9, but Civet's map provided 8. For tokens at the start of the dedented line (like `function`), Civet's column was correct (0).

**Generalizing the Fix:**
1.  The targeted hack was insufficient for the user's reported issue: "other things also shifted after a first line, now tokens are taking 1 symbol more".
2.  I proposed a generalized fix: if `originalColumn_0based_in_snippet > 0`, then add `1` to the `finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte`. This would correct Civet's -1 offset for non-column-0 tokens, while leaving column-0 tokens (which were correct) untouched.
3.  This change was applied to `civetMapToV3.ts`:
    ```typescript
    if (originalColumn_0based_in_snippet > 0) {
        console.log(`[MAP_TO_V3_GENERAL_ADJUST ${svelteFilePath}] Applying +1 to Svelte column. Original Civet col in snippet: ${originalColumn_0based_in_snippet}, Initial Svelte col (indent + Civet col): ${finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte}`);
        adjustedFinalOriginalColumn = finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte + 1;
    }
    ```
4.  After rebuilding (`pnpm --filter svelte2tsx build`), the tests (`pnpm --filter svelte2tsx test-current`) were run again, and they all passed. This indicated the general fix was working correctly for `foo1` and `function`.

**New Issues & Test Expansion:**
1.  The user reported new issues after this generalized fix: "now that approach shifted all other tokens after a first line to a 2 lines to the right and also my foo is for some reason 1 symbol lon when its foo = 3 symbols longeven tho in a right spot (10) is still fucked. other tokens after a first line anomally seems 1 symbol to the right shift now and to have 1 extra symbol in it now for whatever reason".
2.  This suggested the `+1` adjustment, while correct for `foo1` (a first-line token in the snippet), was incorrectly applied to tokens on subsequent lines in the Civet snippet.
3.  I refined the adjustment in `civetMapToV3.ts` to *only* apply if the token is on the *first line* of the Civet snippet (`originalLine_0based_in_snippet === 0`) AND `originalColumn_0based_in_snippet > 0`:
    ```typescript
    if (originalLine_0based_in_snippet === 0 && originalColumn_0based_in_snippet > 0) {
        console.log(`[MAP_TO_V3_GENERAL_ADJUST ${svelteFilePath}] First-line token adjustment: Original Civet col: ${originalColumn_0based_in_snippet}, Initial Svelte col: ${finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte}`);
        adjustedFinalOriginalColumn = finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte + 1;
    }
    ```
4.  To verify this and address the user's request for more comprehensive testing, I:
    *   Modified the test fixture `twoFooUserRequest.svelte` to include a second function `foo2` with a variable `bar`.
        ```svelte
        <script lang="civet">
            function foo1() {
                kekw := "hello, world"
            }
            function foo2() {
                bar := 123
            }
        </script>
        ...
        ```
    *   Expanded the `tokensToVerify` array in `9 - current - userRequest1line.test.ts` to include tests for `kekw` (inside `foo1`), `foo2` (the new function name), and `bar` (inside `foo2`).
        *   `kekw`: expected Svelte L3C2
        *   `foo2`: expected Svelte L5C10
        *   `bar`: expected Svelte L6C2
5.  After rebuilding, the tests were run. They failed. The failure was for the token `bar`: `AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: Token "bar" (occurrence 1) with tsxExactMatch "bar := 123" not found in generated TSX code.`
6.  This was because the `tsxExactMatch` for `bar` was still using Civet syntax (`bar := 123`) instead of the compiled TypeScript syntax (`const bar = 123`).
7.  I corrected the `tsxExactMatch` for the `bar` token in the test file to `const bar = 123`.

The conversation stopped before re-running the tests with the corrected `tsxExactMatch` for `bar` and the refined `+1` adjustment logic (only for first-line, non-col-0 tokens). The primary goal was to ensure tokens on subsequent lines (like `kekw` and `bar`) were not incorrectly shifted by the `+1` adjustment, while first-line tokens like `foo1` and `foo2` still received the necessary correction.

It seems the combination of correcting relCol_0based_in_compiled_ts_snippet in civetMapChainer.ts and removing the offsetting adjustment in normalizeCivetMap.ts has resolved the issue.

## Subsequent Progress: Fixing Hover Length and Refactoring

After the initial plan, further issues and refinements were addressed:

**1. Hover Length Discrepancy (Extra Space Issue):**
*   **User Report:** Tokens within functions (e.g., `kekw` in `fooLet .= () => kekw := '...'`) were being hovered with an extra trailing space (e.g., "kekw " instead of "kekw").
*   **New Test Case:**
    *   Created `hoverInFunction.svelte` fixture:
    ```svelte
    <script lang="civet">
            fooLet .= () =>
                kekw := 'is the foo function'
            fooConst := () =>
                abc := '789';
    </script>
        <div>
            {fooConst}
            {fooLet}
        </div>
    ```
    *   Created `10 - current - hoverInFunction.test.ts` to specifically test `kekw` and `abc`.
*   **Test Enhancement:** Modified the `checkTokenMappings` helper in the test file to not only check character-by-character mapping of the token itself but also to assert that the character *immediately following* the token in the TSX output maps to `null` or a different Svelte position. This was designed to catch the "extra space" hover.
*   **Test Failure Confirmed:** The enhanced test failed as expected, confirming that the character after "kekw" (the space) was indeed mapping to the Svelte character immediately after "kekw", causing the extended hover.
*   **Investigation & Fix in `civetMapToV3.ts` (`normalizeCivetMap`):**
    *   Added detailed logging for "fallback" mappings (segments without a direct token match, like whitespace).
    *   The issue was traced to how `finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte` (now `svelteColIdx`) was calculated for these non-token segments. The previous logic (`svelteLineIndent + snippetOrigCol`) didn't correctly account for the internal indentation of the *Civet snippet line itself*.
    *   **The Fix:** Adjusted the calculation for non-token segments:
    ```typescript
        // ...
        const snippetLineForIndentCalc = snippetLines[effectiveSnippetLineIdx] || '';
        const civetLineIndentMatch = snippetLineForIndentCalc.match(/^\s*/);
        const snippetLineIndent = civetLineIndentMatch ? civetLineIndentMatch[0].length : 0;

        if (snippetOrigCol >= snippetLineIndent) {
          // The character is at or after the Civet line's own internal indent
          svelteColIdx = svelteLineIndent + (snippetOrigCol - snippetLineIndent);
        } else {
          // The character is *within* the Civet line's own internal indent
          svelteColIdx = svelteLineIndent + snippetOrigCol;
        }
        // ...
        ```
        This ensures that the Svelte column is correctly calculated by considering the Civet line's own leading whitespace relative to the `snippetOrigCol` before adding the overall `svelteLineIndent`.
*   **Verification:** After applying this fix and rebuilding, the `10 - current - hoverInFunction.test.ts` passed, including the check for the character after the token.

**2. Code Refactoring in `civetMapToV3.ts`:**
*   **Goal:** Improve readability by shortening verbose variable names.
*   **Key Changes (Examples):**
    *   `originalLine_0based_in_snippet` -> `snippetOrigLine`
    *   `originalColumn_0based_in_snippet` -> `snippetOrigCol`
    *   `generatedLine_0based` -> `tsLineIdx` (in the context of iterating Civet map lines)
    *   `generatedColumn_0based` -> `tsCol` (referring to generated column from Civet map segment)
    *   `finalOriginalLine_0based_in_svelte` -> `svelteLineIdx`
    *   `finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte` -> `svelteColIdx`
    *   `currentSvelteLineIndent` -> `svelteLineIndent`
    *   `effectiveLineIndex` -> `effectiveSnippetLineIdx`
    *   `civetLineInternalIndentLength` -> `snippetLineIndent`
*   **Process:**
    1.  Proposed refactorings.
    2.  Applied changes using `edit_file`.
    3.  Encountered linter errors due to `console.log` statements still using old variable names.
    4.  Fixed linter errors by updating `console.log` statements.
    5.  Rebuilt (`pnpm --filter svelte2tsx build`).
    6.  Ran tests (`pnpm --filter svelte2tsx test-current`).
*   **Result:** All tests passed, confirming the refactoring was successful and did not introduce regressions. The code in `civetMapToV3.ts` is now more concise.

**Current Status (after hover fix and refactoring):**
*   The off-by-one column mapping for first-line tokens (like `foo1`) is resolved.
*   The hover length issue (extra space) for tokens within functions (like `kekw`) is resolved.
*   The `civetMapToV3.ts` code has been refactored for better readability.
*   All relevant tests (`test-current`) are passing.
