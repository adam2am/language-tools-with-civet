I’ve sketched out the “pre-filter + per-stream remapping + merge” refactor in chainMaps—that’s the rock-solid, 2-phase approach:
Decode your baseMap.
For each generated line, split its segments into
• “script” (char-offset in a Civet block)
• “template” (everything else)
Remap all script segments via their individual TraceMap (no more “mixed” fallbacks).
Remap all template segments by simply subtracting the accumulated line-delta.
Stitch them back together in generation order.
This cleanly decouples the two cases and guarantees your template tokens never get (mis)traced through the script chain. Let me know if you’d like me to finish out this refactor now, and I’ll complete the patch and re-run the TSX tests.

# Refactoring Plan: Correcting Sourcemap Offsets for Template Content with Civet Scripts

## 1. Executive Summary & Goals

The primary objective is to correct sourcemap offsets for Svelte template tokens when `<script lang="civet">` blocks are present. Compiling Civet shifts script line counts, and current chaining logic in `civetMapChainer.ts` fails to compensate, causing incorrect template mappings.

**Goals:**
- Accurate sourcemap mapping for template tokens, regardless of preceding Civet script line changes.
- Refactor `chainMaps` in `utils/civetMapChainer.ts` to handle both script and template segments.
- Propagate necessary block metadata from `preprocessCivet` through `svelte2tsx/index.ts` into `chainMaps`.

## 2. Current Situation Analysis

1. **`compileCivet`** (`utils/civetMapLines.ts`): Compiles Civet to TS and provides raw `lines` map.
2. **`normalizeCivetMap`** (`utils/civetMapToV3.ts`): Converts raw lines map → V3 map (TS snippet → original Svelte script). Well tested (#2 mapToV3).
3. **`preprocessCivet`** (`utils/civetPreprocessor.ts`): Replaces `<script lang="civet">` with TS and returns `CivetBlockInfo` (map + char offsets). Verified by #3 preprocessFixtures.
4. **`svelte2tsx/index.ts`**: Generates `baseMap` (TSX → `svelteWithTs`), collects blocks, calls `chainMaps`.
5. **`chainMaps`** (`utils/civetMapChainer.ts`): CURRENTLY ignores `tsStart`/`tsEnd` and applies Civet tracer to _all_ baseMap segments → corrupts template mappings.

**Pain Point**: Template mappings aren't adjusted for script-induced line shifts, as shown by #8 and #8.1 tests.

## 3. Proposed Solution / Refactoring Strategy

### 3.1 High-Level Design
- **Data Augmentation**: Enrich `CivetBlockInfo` with line counts (`originalCivetLineCount`, `compiledTsLineCount`) and script start/end positions in both char and line/column form.
- **EnhancedChainBlock**: Define a richer block type for `chainMaps` carrying all offsets and line counts.
- **Refactored `chainMaps`**: Single-pass remapping:
  - _Script segments_: trace through Civet map (relative coords).
  - _Template segments_: compute cumulative line delta from preceding blocks and adjust original line.

### 3.2 Key Files & Modules
- **`utils/civetPreprocessor.ts`**: Augment `CivetBlockInfo`.
- **`utils/civetTypes.ts`**: Update `CivetBlockInfo` interface.
- **`svelte2tsx/index.ts`**: Collect and convert block offsets into `EnhancedChainBlock[]`.
- **`utils/civetMapChainer.ts`**: Refactor `chainMaps` to use `EnhancedChainBlock` and adjust template mappings.

## 4. Detailed Action Plan

### Phase 1: Data Augmentation & Propagation
- **Task 1.1**: Update `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/utils/civetTypes.ts`:
  - Add `originalCivetLineCount: number; compiledTsLineCount: number;` to `CivetBlockInfo`.
- **Task 1.2**: Modify `preprocessCivet` in `utils/civetPreprocessor.ts`:
  - Calculate `originalCivetLineCount = dedentedSnippet.split('\n').length`.
  - Calculate `compiledTsLineCount = compiledTsCode.split('\n').length`.
  - Populate these fields in returned block info.
- **Task 1.3**: Define `EnhancedChainBlock` in `utils/civetMapChainer.ts`:
  ```ts
  interface EnhancedChainBlock {
    map: EncodedSourceMap;
    tsStartChar: number;
    tsEndChar: number;
    tsStartLine: number; // 1-based
    tsStartCol: number;  // 0-based
    tsEndLine: number;
    originalCivetLineCount: number;
    compiledTsLineCount: number;
  }
  ```
