After reviewing the code and logs, I believe I've pinpointed the issue. The removedCivetContentIndentLength value is being misapplied, causing a one-column shift in the token's position during the normalizeCivetMap process. This results in the misplacement of the 'f' token by one column to the left. The svelteScriptTagIndent, and originalColumnInCivetSnippet_0based calculations all align. Now I'm focusing on the condition where the removedCivetContentIndentLength is applied.


The problem is that dedentedSnippet has no leading indent. So originalColumn_0based_in_snippet is already the "correct" column if we imagine the dedented snippet placed at the svelteScriptTagIndent position.



finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte = 7 + 2 = 9. This matches!
This strongly implies that originalColumn_0based_in_snippet from civet.compile() is relative to the start of the first non-whitespace character on its line in the dedented input, OR, the Civet compiler itself is "eating" the export function part for its column count for foo1. This is unlikely for export.


then normalizeCivetMap calculates finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte = 7 + 2 (indent) = 9.
This 9 (0-indexed) IS the expected Svelte column for f of foo1.
This is the breakthrough!
The Civet compiler (compileCivet) must be providing originalColumn_0based_in_snippet relative to the start of the containing token or a relevant preceding token on the same line, NOT necessarily from the absolute start of the dedented line for all sub-tokens. Or, it provides columns as if the export function part is "atomic" for foo1.
If normalizeCivetMap correctly computes finalOriginalColumn_0based_in_svelte = 9 for foo1, then its output map (block.map) should correctly map foo1.

This strongly suggests normalizeCivetMap is correctly calculating the target Svelte columns based on the originalColumn_0based_in_snippet it receives from the Civet compiler's map. If the Civet compiler says f in foo1 (within export function foo1) is at column 7 (relative to e of export), then normalizeCivetMap correctly derives the final Svelte column 9 (0-indexed).


Root Cause:
The svelte2tsx utility, when generating the initial baseMap for a Svelte file that will undergo Civet preprocessing, creates an incorrect mapping for identifiers like foo1 that are inside the script block. It seems to be off by the length of "function " or similar, mapping foo1 to an earlier part of the line (export or the space after it) in the svelteWithTs representation.
When there's no Civet processing (the _TS.svelte case), this baseMap might be "less wrong" or the structure of the generated TSX is different such that it coincidentally works or the error is smaller. The single segment [0,0,0,18] for the TS baseline suggests a much simpler TSX structure for that line.



Why is baseMap different and problematic for the Civet case?
svelte2tsx first calls preprocessCivet. This modifies the Svelte string (svelte) into svelteWithTs by changing lang="civet" to lang="ts" and storing the Civet compilation results.
Then, processSvelteTemplate and subsequent Svelte-to-TSX transformations operate on svelteWithTs using a MagicString (str = new MagicString(svelteWithTs)).
The baseMap is str.generateMap().
The problem is likely in how svelte2tsx's core script processing (processInstanceScriptContent, createRenderFunction, etc.) handles the script content after preprocessCivet has made its changes. The character offsets or AST node positions used by MagicString to create baseMap might be misaligned for tokens like foo1 specifically because the script content it's mapping from (svelteWithTs) has already been processed once by preprocessCivet.
This is a bug in svelte2tsx's main logic when dealing with preprocessed script tags before generating its own baseMap. The baseMap needs to accurately reflect the mapping from the final TSX back to the svelteWithTs string, especially for identifiers within that script.



Conclusion:
The primary bug lies in svelte2tsx/index.ts's generation of baseMap when dealing with Svelte files that have had their script tags modified by preprocessCivet. The baseMap incorrectly maps identifiers from the final TSX (like foo1) back to an earlier position (like export) in the intermediate svelteWithTs string.
This incorrect baseMap is then fed into chainMaps, leading to the wrong segment of the Civet TS snippet being queried against the (correctly generated) normalizedCivetMap.

Recommendations:
The fix needs to happen in svelte2tsx/index.ts to ensure that str.generateMap() (which creates baseMap) accurately maps from the generated TSX back to the correct character positions in the svelteWithTs string, especially for identifiers within the script block that was modified by preprocessCivet.
This likely involves carefully reviewing:
How MagicString operations (like str.move, str.overwrite) are used on the svelteWithTs string.
How AST node positions from parseHtmlx (run on svelteWithTs) are used to guide MagicString transformations and map generation.
The script processing logic in processInstanceScriptContent and how it interacts with the already lang="ts"-modified script tag.
