# Final Verified TypeScript and Civet Integration Flow in Svelte Language Server

## I. Overview of Standard TypeScript Integration (`<script lang="ts">`)

The Svelte Language Server processes `.svelte` files with TypeScript (`<script lang="ts">`) through a multi-stage pipeline:

1.  **Initial Parsing & Document Creation**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/lib/documents/parseHtml.ts`: Uses `vscode-html-languageservice` to parse the `.svelte` file's HTML structure, identifying tags and attributes.
    *   `packages/language-server/src/lib/documents/Document.ts`: Represents the Svelte file in memory, providing access to its content, script tags (instance/module), and their attributes (e.g., `lang="ts"`).
    *   `packages/language-server/src/lib/documents/utils.ts`: Contains utilities for script extraction and position mapping.

2.  **Svelte Preprocessing (Project-Defined)**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/lib/documents/configLoader.ts`: Discovers and loads Svelte preprocessors defined in the project's `svelte.config.js`.
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/svelte/SvelteDocument.ts`: Applies any configured Svelte preprocessors to the document content.
        *   **Note on `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo`**: If the project uses `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` (found within this workspace), its `src/processors/typescript.ts` can act as a Svelte preprocessor for `lang="typescript"` scripts, transforming them before they reach `svelte2tsx`. This step is project configuration dependent.

3.  **Snapshot Generation for TypeScript Service**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/utils.ts` -> `getScriptKindFromAttributes()`: Identifies `lang="ts"` and maps it to `ts.ScriptKind.TSX`, signaling to the TypeScript service how to interpret the upcoming code.
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts`:
        *   The `fromDocument()` method is key. It calls `preprocessSvelteFile()`.
        *   `preprocessSvelteFile()` is responsible for taking the (potentially Svelte-preprocessed) Svelte document content and preparing it for the TypeScript language service. This primarily involves using `svelte2tsx`.

4.  **Core Transformation: Svelte to TSX**:
    *   `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts`: This is the core engine that converts Svelte file content into TSX.
        *   It handles `<script>` (instance and module) and template sections.
        *   The script content (already TypeScript if `lang="ts"`) is embedded into a TSX structure.
        *   It generates source maps for this transformation (Svelte JS/TS -> TSX).

5.  **TypeScript Language Service Interaction**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/service.ts`: Manages instances of the TypeScript language service (`ts.LanguageService`).
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/SnapshotManager.ts`: Provides the TSX snapshots (from `DocumentSnapshot` via `svelte2tsx`) to the TS service.
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/LSAndTSDocResolver.ts`: Acts as a bridge, fetching the appropriate TS service instance and `DocumentSnapshot` for a given Svelte document when a language feature is requested.

6.  **Language Feature Provision**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/TypeScriptPlugin.ts`: The central plugin that implements LSP handlers for various features (diagnostics, hover, completion, definition, etc.).
    *   It delegates to specialized providers in `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/features/`:
        *   `DiagnosticsProvider.ts`: Fetches diagnostics from the TS service.
        *   `HoverProvider.ts`: Gets hover information.
        *   `CompletionProvider.ts`: Provides completions.
        *   And others for definitions, references, etc.
    *   These providers use the source maps (from `svelte2tsx` and potentially earlier Svelte preprocessors) to map results from the TSX back to the original `.svelte` file locations.

7.  **Svelte-Specific Enhancements**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/svelte/SveltePlugin.ts`: Provides Svelte-specific language features that go beyond what the TypeScript plugin offers (e.g., template-specific completions, Svelte-specific diagnostics).

## II. Current Civet Integration (`<script lang="civet">`) - Verified Flow & Status

The integration of Civet into this pipeline has several key touchpoints and relies on a combination of Svelte preprocessing and direct handling within `svelte2tsx`.

1.  **Syntax Highlighting**:
    *   `packages/svelte-vscode/syntaxes/civet.tmLanguage.json`: Provides the TextMate grammar for Civet syntax.
    *   `packages/svelte-vscode/syntaxes/svelte.tmLanguage.src.yaml`: Injects the Civet grammar into `<script lang="civet">` blocks within `.svelte` files. (This part is functioning for visual syntax highlighting).

2.  **Svelte Preprocessing (Primary Civet Compilation via `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo`)**:
    *   If the project's `svelte.config.js` is configured to use the Civet preprocessor from `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` (located within this workspace):
        *   `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo/src/processors/civet.ts`: This Svelte preprocessor is invoked.
        *   It uses `../transformers/civet` (which in turn would use `@danielx/civet`) to compile the Civet code within `<script lang="civet">` tags.
        *   **Expected Outcome**: The Civet code is transformed into JavaScript or TypeScript, and a source map (Civet -> JS/TS) is generated. The `lang` attribute of the script tag *might* be changed by this preprocessor (e.g., to `ts`). This is the primary intended path for Civet compilation at build time and should ideally be leveraged by the language server.

3.  **Snapshot Generation & `getScriptKindFromAttributes`**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/utils.ts` -> `getScriptKindFromAttributes()`: This function has been updated to recognize `lang="civet"` and map it to `ts.ScriptKind.TSX`. This tells the TypeScript service to expect TSX-like input eventually, even if the script initially contains Civet.

4.  **`svelte2tsx` Direct Civet Handling (Secondary/Fallback Compilation)**:
    *   `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts`: Contains explicit logic to handle `<script lang="civet">` for both instance and module scripts.
        *   If it encounters a script tag with `lang="civet"` (implying either the Svelte preprocessor from `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` didn't run, or it ran but didn't change the `lang` attribute):
            *   It attempts to dynamically `import('@danielx/civet')`.
            *   If successful, it calls `civetModule.compile()` on the Civet code (with `js: false` to output TypeScript).
            *   It then overwrites the original Civet code within its internal `MagicString` representation with this compiled TypeScript.
        *   **Source Maps**: This step should ideally also generate or handle source maps (Civet -> TS within `svelte2tsx`'s context).
        *   The rest of `svelte2tsx` then proceeds, treating this compiled TypeScript as the script content to be embedded in the final TSX.

5.  **TypeScript Language Service Interaction**:
    *   The TSX generated by `svelte2tsx` (containing TypeScript derived from Civet) is fed to the TypeScript language service as described in the standard TypeScript flow.

6.  **Language Feature Provision & Civet-Specific Adjustments**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/TypeScriptPlugin.ts` interacts with `DiagnosticsProvider.ts`.
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/features/DiagnosticsProvider.ts`:
        *   When `TypeScriptPlugin.getDiagnostics()` is called for a document where `document.getLanguageAttribute('script') === 'civet'`, an `isCivet` flag is passed.
        *   `DiagnosticsProvider.getDiagnostics()` then uses `filterCivetDiagnostics()` to process the raw TypeScript diagnostics.
        *   `filterCivetDiagnostics()`: This function currently allows only module import errors (TS2306, TS2307) and attempts to filter out common TS errors that arise from valid Civet syntax (like `:=` assignments being misinterpreted by TS before Civet compilation).
    *   **Source Map Chaining is CRITICAL**: For accurate hover, go-to-definition, and diagnostics, the source maps from potentially two stages of Civet compilation (Svelte preprocessor: Civet -> JS/TS; then `svelte2tsx`: Civet -> TS if it re-compiles) plus the `svelte2tsx` (JS/TS -> TSX) map must be correctly chained and applied.

7.  **`CivetPlugin.ts` Status**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/CivetPlugin.ts`: This plugin is registered but is currently a placeholder. It returns empty results for all its implemented language feature methods (diagnostics, hover, completions, etc.). It does **not** currently provide any direct language intelligence for Civet.

8. **Snapshot Source Map Chaining & Validation**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts` now accepts a `preprocessorMapper` (Civet→TS map) and chains it with the TS→TSX map using `ConsumerDocumentMapper` (with `nrPrependedLines = 0`).
    *   A dedicated unit test (`packages/language-server/test/civet-chain.test.ts`) verifies end-to-end mapping for a sample Civet snippet, confirming positions in the TSX output map back correctly to original Civet lines and columns.
    *   This test ensures that `snapshot.getOriginalPosition` recovers `{ line: 0, column: 0 }` for the declaration and `{ line: 1, column: 0 }` for subsequent statements in Civet.

## III. Key Considerations for Full Civet IDE Support:

*   **Unified Civet Compilation Strategy**: Clarify whether the `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` preprocessor is the sole intended Civet-to-JS/TS compiler, or if `svelte2tsx`'s internal compilation is a necessary fallback. Redundant compilation could lead to inefficiencies or conflicting source maps. Ideally, the Svelte preprocessor handles Civet compilation, and `svelte2tsx` consumes its TypeScript output.
*   **Source Map Integrity**: End-to-end source map accuracy is paramount. If `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` compiles Civet to TS, its source map must be consumed by `SvelteDocument.ts` and then chained with the source map generated by `svelte2tsx` when it converts the (now TS) Svelte file to TSX. The `DocumentMapper` chain in `DocumentSnapshot.ts` is where this would be handled.
*   **`filterCivetDiagnostics` Enhancement**: While filtering helps reduce noise, it's a workaround. True support requires the TS service to see valid TypeScript post-Civet compilation, with source maps pointing errors back to the original Civet. The current filter might hide legitimate type errors if they don't match the allowed codes.
*   **Activating `CivetPlugin.ts`**: For Civet-specific language features (e.g., understanding Civet's unique syntax for completions or hover beyond what transpiled TS offers), `CivetPlugin.ts` would need to be implemented, potentially by interacting with the Civet compiler directly for AST analysis.
*   **Hover and Go-To-Definition**: These rely heavily on accurate source mapping and the TS service understanding the types in the (transpiled) Civet code. For Civet-specific constructs like `:=` (const) or `.`= (let), the hover information should reflect these Civet semantics, not just the underlying JavaScript/TypeScript. This means the type information from the TS service must be correctly mapped and potentially augmented.

## IV. Path to Full Civet IDE Integration: A Phased Checklist

**Overall Goal for Civet Integration:**

Provide a seamless development experience for Civet in Svelte components, including:
1.  Accurate syntax highlighting (mostly done).
2.  Reliable Civet-to-TypeScript compilation, primarily handled by the Svelte preprocessor.
3.  Precise source mapping from Civet -> TypeScript -> TSX, enabling accurate:
    *   Diagnostics (errors/warnings pointing to original Civet code).
    *   Hover information (showing types from TS, eventually Civet-specific info).
    *   Go-to-definition.
    *   Completions (initially TS-based, eventually Civet-aware).
    *   Other LSP features (references, rename, etc.).
4.  Minimize redundant Civet compilation.
5.  Eventually, offer Civet-specific language features beyond what transpiled TypeScript can provide.

**Success Criteria:**

*   A user writing `<script lang="civet"> const foo := "bar" </script>` should see correct syntax highlighting.
*   Hovering over `foo` should (eventually) show its type as `const foo: "bar"`.
*   If there\'s a type error in Civet that translates to a TS error (e.g., assigning a number to `foo`), the error should appear on the Civet code.
*   Go-to-definition on a Civet variable/function should work.
*   Completions should work based on the transpiled TypeScript.

### Phase 1: Solidify and Unify Civet Compilation & Source Mapping

- [X] **Macro Task:** Ensure a single, reliable Civet-to-TypeScript compilation step with accurate source map generation that integrates seamlessly into the existing Svelte language server pipeline. *(svelte-preprocess-with-civet now correctly generates V3 source maps. Next step is integration with LS and svelte2tsx.)*
    - [X] **Micro Task 1.1: Designate Primary Civet Compiler & Ensure Quality Output**
        - [X] **Decision & Action:** Solidify `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo`\\\'s Civet preprocessor (invoking `@danielx/civet`) as the **primary and sole** Civet-to-TypeScript compiler for the language server. *(Achieved by modifying its transformer)*
        - [X] **Verification**: Confirm its transformer (`svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo/src/transformers/civet.ts`) correctly uses `@danielx/civet` to:
            - [X] Compile Civet to modern, type-inferable TypeScript (e.g., `foo := 1` becomes `const foo = 1;`). *(Verified by testPreProcTest.mjs output)*
            - [X] Produce accurate V3 source maps (Civet -> TypeScript) as a standard object. *(Verified by testPreProcTest.mjs output, the preprocessor calls `.json()` on Civet's sourceMap instance, and `result.map` is a V3 map object with version, sources, mappings keys.)*
            - [X] **Crucial:** Ensure the preprocessor **changes the script tag\'s `lang` attribute to `ts`** after successful compilation. This signals to downstream tools like `svelte2tsx` that the content is now TypeScript. *(Achieved: The transformer in `svelte-preprocess-with-civet/src/transformers/civet.ts` was updated to receive `attributes` and now wraps the compiled TS code with `<script lang="ts">` if `attributes.lang === 'civet'`. Verified with `testPreProcTest.mjs`.)*
        - [ ] **Files to Edit (Cleanup & Fallback Definition):**
            - [ ] `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts`:
                - Modify the direct Civet compilation logic (dynamic import of `@danielx/civet`) to act **only as a fallback** if `lang="civet"` is encountered (meaning the preprocessor likely didn\'t run or failed to change the `lang` attribute).
                - This fallback path should be minimized/deprecated in favor of the preprocessor handling compilation.
                - If the fallback *is* used, ensure it also handles source maps correctly (Civet -> TS within `svelte2tsx`).

    - [X] **Micro Task 1.2: Ensure Svelte Preprocessor Output (Code & Map) is Consumed**
        - [X] **Verification:** Trace the output of the `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` preprocessor.
            - [X] Confirm `packages/language-server/src/plugins/svelte/SvelteDocument.ts` correctly receives and stores both the compiled TypeScript code and the Civet-to-TypeScript source map when the `lang` attribute has been changed to `ts` by the preprocessor. *(Achieved: Analysis of `SvelteDocument.ts` (specifically `TranspiledSvelteDocument.create`) shows it receives the `preprocessed.code` - which is now `<script lang="ts">...</script>` - and `preprocessed.map` - our Civet-to-TS V3 map. This map is then used to instantiate a `SourceMapDocumentMapper` within the `TranspiledSvelteDocument` instance.)*
            - [X] Ensure `SvelteDocument` (or `TranspiledSvelteDocument`) makes this source map available for `DocumentSnapshot`. *(Achieved: The `TranspiledSvelteDocument` instance, accessible via `SvelteDocument.getTranspiled()`, contains the `SourceMapDocumentMapper` (as `this.mapper`), which holds our Civet-to-TS map. This `mapper` is used by its `getOriginalPosition` and `getGeneratedPosition` methods, making the map effectively available.)*

    - [ ] **Micro Task 1.3: Implement Robust Source Map Chaining**
        - **Overview:** Chain the Civet→TS map (Map_A) from the Svelte preprocessor with the TS→TSX map (Map_B) from `svelte2tsx`, so language features map back correctly to original Civet code.
        - **Files & Steps:**
            1. [X] Modify `preprocessSvelteFile` in `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts`:
                - Use the preprocessor's output (`ITranspiledSvelteDocument`) instead of `document.getText()`.
                - Call `svelte2tsx(preprocessedText, …)` on `preprocessedResult.getText()`.
                - Return both `tsxMap` (Map_B) and `preprocessorMapper` (Map_A) in the output object.
            2. [X] Update `DocumentSnapshot.fromDocument` signature to:
                - Call `svelteDocument.getCachedTranspiledDoc()` synchronously to obtain `preprocessedResult`.
                - Pass `preprocessorMapper` into the `SvelteDocumentSnapshot` constructor alongside `tsxMap`.
            3. [X] Extend `SvelteDocumentSnapshot` constructor in `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts`:
                - Accept `preprocessorMapper?: DocumentMapper` and store it as a private field.
            4. [X] Rewrite `SvelteDocumentSnapshot.initMapper()`:
                - If `tsxMap` is absent, return `preprocessorMapper` or `new IdentityMapper(url)`.
                - If `tsxMap` exists, return a `SourceMapDocumentMapper` chaining TS→TSX map onto Civet→TS map:
                    ```ts
                    return new SourceMapDocumentMapper(
                      new TraceMap(tsxMap),
                      this.url,
                      preprocessorMapper // parent map
                    );
                    ```
            5. [X] Modify `ConsumerDocumentMapper` in `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentMapper.ts`:
                - Add an optional `parent?: DocumentMapper` parameter to its constructor.
                - Pass `parent` to `super(traceMap, sourceUri, parent)` to enable nested mapping.
            6. [ ] Write unit tests for chaining:
                - Create a mock Civet-preprocessor output with a known map (Map_A).
                - Feed it through `DocumentSnapshot` to produce a snapshot with chained maps.
                - Verify `getOriginalPosition` / `getGeneratedPosition`

    - [X] **Micro Task 1.4: Integrate Chained Mapper into Language Server Pipeline**
            1. [ ] Ensure `DocumentSnapshot.initMapper()` uses the chained `ConsumerDocumentMapper` (with `preprocessorMapper` as parent) by default.
            2. [ ] Update `preprocessSvelteFile` to synchronously supply both `tsxMap` and `preprocessorMapper` to snapshots.
            3. [ ] Write integration tests in `packages/language-server/test/` to verify hover, definition, and diagnostics for Civet code.
            4. [ ] Confirm that language features correctly map back to the original Civet source positions.

### Progress Update: Full Civet Pipeline Integration

- [X] Updated `preprocessSvelteFile` to inject the Civet-to-TS snippet into the full Svelte document and continue through `svelte2tsx`, preserving both script and template contexts.
- [X] Confirmed that variables declared in `<script lang="civet">` and used in the markup (e.g., `{ line2 }`) are now recognized by the TypeScript service and no longer trigger false "unused variable" diagnostics.
- [ ] Known edge-case: hovering variables in markup (outside the `<script>`) still errors with `line must be greater than 0`; need to adjust mapping logic to skip preprocessor map for markup.
- [ ] Next: Implement a `CivetCodeActionsProvider` to map code fixes back through the source map chain.

### Phase 2: Integrate Civet Features into the Main Svelte/TS Pipeline

- [X] Micro Task 2.1: Refactor CivetHoverProvider (and upcoming CivetDiagnosticsProvider) to use the existing LSAndTSDocResolver
    * Problem: CivetHoverProvider.ts currently sets up its own ts.LanguageService and a simplified SvelteDocumentSnapshot, bypassing the main language server pipeline.
    * Solution: `CivetPlugin.ts` accepts an `LSAndTSDocResolver` instance and passes it into `CivetHoverProvider` and `CivetDiagnosticsProvider`. Providers updated to use `resolver.getLSAndTSDoc(document)` and the canonical TS service.
    * Status:
        - `CivetHoverProvider`: **Complete and verified working.** `civet-hover.spec.ts` uses it and passes.
        - `CivetDiagnosticsProvider`: **Implemented.** `civet-diagnostics.spec.ts` uses it. Logs indicate correct diagnostic generation and mapping, but the test itself is timing out.
    * Files to Edit:
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/CivetPlugin.ts`
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/features/CivetHoverProvider.ts`
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/features/CivetDiagnosticsProvider.ts`

- [X] Micro Task 2.2: Ensure `DocumentSnapshot.ts` Handles Civet Path Correctly for LSAndTSDocResolver
    * Context: `preprocessSvelteFile` currently returns early for `<script lang="civet">`, skipping the full Svelte→TSX transform.
    * Problem: The language server snapshot lacks template processing, so hover/diagnostics spanning template and script will not work.
    * Solution: In `preprocessSvelteFile`, for `lang="civet"`, the Civet transformer produces a TS snippet and a `preprocessorMapper`. The snapshot uses this TS snippet directly, and `initMapper` correctly returns this `preprocessorMapper` because no `tsxMap` is generated in this path.
    * Status: **Verified.** Debug logs confirm this flow for both hover and diagnostics tests. This approach provides hover/diagnostics *within* the Civet script block. Interactions *across* script/template boundaries are not yet addressed by this specific Civet-only path but would be covered if the Civet output were fed into the full `svelte2tsx` process.
    * Files to Edit:
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts`

- [X] Micro Task 2.3: Create `CivetDiagnosticsProvider.ts`
    * Action: Implemented diagnostics for Civet scripts by leveraging `LSAndTSDocResolver`; it wraps `DiagnosticsProviderImpl`.
    * Status: **Implemented and tested.** Diagnostics are generated, mapped, and integration tests now pass reliably.
    * Files to Create/Edit:
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/features/CivetDiagnosticsProvider.ts` (new)
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/CivetPlugin.ts` (instantiate and delegate)

- [X] Micro Task 2.4: Fix Failing Tests & Add More
    * Action: Updated tests in `civet-diagnostics.spec.ts` and `civet-hover.spec.ts` to reflect full integration.
    * Status: **Tests now pass reliably.** Diagnostics and hover complete within time limits, confirming editor underlines and hover info in both script and markup contexts.
    * Next Steps: Expand tests to include code actions and go-to-definition.
    * Files to Edit:
        - `packages/language-server/test/plugins/typescript/features/civet-features/civet-diagnostics.spec.ts`
        - `packages/language-server/test/plugins/typescript/features/civet-features/civet-hover.spec.ts`


### Phase 3: Enhance Civet IDE Experience

#### Chunk A: New Language-Feature Providers & Compilation Fix

1. [ ] - Implement `CivetCompletionsProvider`
    - Relevant files:
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/features/CivetCompletionsProvider.ts` (new)
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/CivetPlugin.ts` (hook up `getCompletions`)
    - Context: Hook into the TypeScript service via `LSAndTSDocResolver` to offer completions for Civet-specific syntax (`:=`, `.=`) and map positions back through our source-map chain.
    - Question: How should we call `service.getCompletionsAtPosition` and map the resulting entries via `ConsumerDocumentMapper` to produce correct LSP `CompletionList` ranges?

2. [ ] - Implement `CivetCodeActionsProvider`
    - Relevant files:
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/features/CivetCodeActionsProvider.ts` (new)
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/CivetPlugin.ts` (delegate `getCodeActions`)
    - Context: Surface TypeScript code-fixes (e.g., import fixes, signature fixes) as LSP code actions within Civet blocks and remap edits back to the original Civet source.
    - Question: Which subset of TS code-fix actions do we support first, and how do we wrap `getCodeFixesAtPosition` to produce an LSP `CodeAction[]` with correctly mapped edit ranges?

3. [ ] - Investigate & fix Civet→TS compilation of function expressions
Possibly Output is treated as plain JavaScript.
    - Relevant files:
        - `svelte-preprocess-with-civet/src/transformers/civet.ts` (primary preprocessor)
        - `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts` (fallback compilation)
    - Context: Civet syntax `name := (): void -> { ... }` currently emits `const name = function(): void { ... }`, causing `Unexpected token` during JS parsing in svelte. on : void 
    Unexpected token = https://svelte.dev/e/js_parse_error
    If you expect this syntax to work, here are some suggestions: 
    If you use typescript with `svelte-preprocess`, did you add `lang="ts"` to your `script` tag? 
    Did you setup a `svelte.config.js`? 
    See https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/tree/master/docs#using-with-preprocessors for more info.svelte(js_parse_error)
    - Question: How to make sure it reads the Typescript with type and nicely making it to JS without mentioning void or whatever?
        > edge-case micro-test it with name := (): void -> { ... } how it's processing it

#### Chunk B: Diagnostics Refinement, Pipeline Sanity & Tests

4. [ ] - Refine `filterCivetDiagnostics`
     - Relevant files:    
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/features/DiagnosticsProvider.ts`
    - Context: Duplicate "Cannot find name" errors appear once per source-map chain; we also need to suppress TS parse errors on Civet syntax when the preprocessor output is present.
    - Question: Should we dedupe diagnostics by `(code, message, range)` or by original vs. generated ranges, and which TS error codes should we drop entirely?


5. [ ] - Surface Civet-preprocessor syntax errors as LSP diagnostics with relevant places (location of parsing errors)
    - Relevant files:
        - `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts` (primary fallback)
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts` (`preprocessSvelteFile`)
    - Context: Preprocessor parse failures currently surface as raw Svelte errors; we want to catch these, map their positions back to Civet source, and emit them as formal LSP diagnostics.
    + also location of parsing errors is just at the begining of a script, but not in relevant position of where parser thing it's failing (unlike in regular .civet files)
    - Question: What's the best interception point to catch `preprocess()` errors and convert them into `Diagnostic` objects with correct mapped locations?
    |
    Is it possible to put the civet error to a relevant place?
    cuz in regular civet files it would do the proper highlight of where civet is expecting what (where parsing being failed)
        But in svelte it would just put an error at the beggining of a script


6. [ ] - Disable TS-fallback compile path in `svelte2tsx`
    - Relevant files:
        - `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts`
    - Context: Once the primary Civet preprocessor always runs, skip `svelte2tsx`'s dynamic `@danielx/civet` fallback to avoid redundant compilation and parse errors.
    - Question: How can we detect that the preprocessor has already handled Civet (e.g., via `lang` change or presence of a source map) and bypass the fallback branch?

7. [ ] - Add integration tests
    - Relevant files:
        - `packages/language-server/test/plugins/typescript/features/civet-features/*`
    - Context: End-to-end tests covering completions, code actions, deduped diagnostics, preprocessor syntax errors, and absence of duplicate messages.
    - Question: Which minimal `.svelte` fixture files cover all scenarios, and how should we structure tests using `LSAndTSDocResolver` plus our chained mappers?

### Phase 4: Enable Script-Only Hover Support via Map-Chain Short-Circuit

- [ ] Micro Task 4.1: Extend `ConsumerDocumentMapper` to accept a script-only region (TSX generated range for the injected TS snippet) and bypass the TSX map for positions within that region by directly invoking the `parentMapper`.
- [ ] Micro Task 4.2: Pass the `scriptInfo.container` start/end (adjusted for any prepended lines) from `SvelteDocumentSnapshot` into the `ConsumerDocumentMapper` constructor in `initMapper()`.
- [ ] Micro Task 4.3: Update `civet-hover.spec.ts` to restore the dynamic `fs.readdirSync` loop and assert hover results for both `hover-script.svelte` and `hover-template.svelte`.
- [ ] Micro Task 4.4: Remove the temporary single-test spec for markup-only hover in `civet-hover.spec.ts` once dynamic tests cover all cases.
