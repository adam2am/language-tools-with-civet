# Final Verified TypeScript and Civet Integration Flow in Svelte Language Server

## I. Overview of Standard TypeScript Integration (`<script lang="ts">`)

The Svelte Language Server processes `.svelte` files with TypeScript (`<script lang="ts">`) through a multi-stage pipeline:

1.  **Initial Parsing & Document Creation**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/lib/documents/parseHtml.ts`: Uses `vscode-html-languageservice` to parse the `.svelte` file's HTML structure, identifying tags and attributes.
    *   `packages/language-server/src/lib/documents/Document.ts`: Represents the Svelte file in memory, providing access to its content, script tags (instance/module), and their attributes (e.g., `lang="ts"`).
    *   `packages/language-server/src/lib/documents/utils.ts`: Contains utilities for script extraction and position mapping.

2.  **Svelte Preprocessing (Project-Defined)**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/lib/documents/configLoader.ts`: Discovers and loads Svelte preprocessors defined in the project's `svelte.config.js`.
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/svelte/SvelteDocument.ts`: Applies any configured Svelte preprocessors to the document content.
        *   **Note on `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo`**: If the project uses `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` (found within this workspace), its `src/processors/typescript.ts` can act as a Svelte preprocessor for `lang="typescript"` scripts, transforming them before they reach `svelte2tsx`. This step is project configuration dependent.

3.  **Snapshot Generation for TypeScript Service**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/utils.ts` -> `getScriptKindFromAttributes()`: Identifies `lang="ts"` and maps it to `ts.ScriptKind.TSX`, signaling to the TypeScript service how to interpret the upcoming code.
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts`:
        *   The `fromDocument()` method is key. It calls `preprocessSvelteFile()`.
        *   `preprocessSvelteFile()` is responsible for taking the (potentially Svelte-preprocessed) Svelte document content and preparing it for the TypeScript language service. This primarily involves using `svelte2tsx`.

4.  **Core Transformation: Svelte to TSX**:
    *   `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts`: This is the core engine that converts Svelte file content into TSX.
        *   It handles `<script>` (instance and module) and template sections.
        *   The script content (already TypeScript if `lang="ts"`) is embedded into a TSX structure.
        *   It generates source maps for this transformation (Svelte JS/TS -> TSX).

5.  **TypeScript Language Service Interaction**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/service.ts`: Manages instances of the TypeScript language service (`ts.LanguageService`).
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/SnapshotManager.ts`: Provides the TSX snapshots (from `DocumentSnapshot` via `svelte2tsx`) to the TS service.
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/LSAndTSDocResolver.ts`: Acts as a bridge, fetching the appropriate TS service instance and `DocumentSnapshot` for a given Svelte document when a language feature is requested.

6.  **Language Feature Provision**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/TypeScriptPlugin.ts`: The central plugin that implements LSP handlers for various features (diagnostics, hover, completion, definition, etc.).
    *   It delegates to specialized providers in `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/features/`:
        *   `DiagnosticsProvider.ts`: Fetches diagnostics from the TS service.
        *   `HoverProvider.ts`: Gets hover information.
        *   `CompletionProvider.ts`: Provides completions.
        *   And others for definitions, references, etc.
    *   These providers use the source maps (from `svelte2tsx` and potentially earlier Svelte preprocessors) to map results from the TSX back to the original `.svelte` file locations.

7.  **Svelte-Specific Enhancements**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/svelte/SveltePlugin.ts`: Provides Svelte-specific language features that go beyond what the TypeScript plugin offers (e.g., template-specific completions, Svelte-specific diagnostics).

## II. Current Civet Integration (`<script lang="civet">`) - Verified Flow & Status

The integration of Civet into this pipeline has several key touchpoints and relies on a combination of Svelte preprocessing and direct handling within `svelte2tsx`.

1.  **Syntax Highlighting**:
    *   `packages/svelte-vscode/syntaxes/civet.tmLanguage.json`: Provides the TextMate grammar for Civet syntax.
    *   `packages/svelte-vscode/syntaxes/svelte.tmLanguage.src.yaml`: Injects the Civet grammar into `<script lang="civet">` blocks within `.svelte` files. (This part is functioning for visual syntax highlighting).

2.  **Svelte Preprocessing (Primary Civet Compilation via `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo`)**:
    *   If the project's `svelte.config.js` is configured to use the Civet preprocessor from `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` (located within this workspace):
        *   `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo/src/processors/civet.ts`: This Svelte preprocessor is invoked.
        *   It uses `../transformers/civet` (which in turn would use `@danielx/civet`) to compile the Civet code within `<script lang="civet">` tags.
        *   **Expected Outcome**: The Civet code is transformed into JavaScript or TypeScript, and a source map (Civet -> JS/TS) is generated. The `lang` attribute of the script tag *might* be changed by this preprocessor (e.g., to `ts`). This is the primary intended path for Civet compilation at build time and should ideally be leveraged by the language server.

3.  **Snapshot Generation & `getScriptKindFromAttributes`**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/utils.ts` -> `getScriptKindFromAttributes()`: This function has been updated to recognize `lang="civet"` and map it to `ts.ScriptKind.TSX`. This tells the TypeScript service to expect TSX-like input eventually, even if the script initially contains Civet.

4.  **`svelte2tsx` Direct Civet Handling (Secondary/Fallback Compilation)**:
    *   `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts`: Contains explicit logic to handle `<script lang="civet">` for both instance and module scripts.
        *   If it encounters a script tag with `lang="civet"` (implying either the Svelte preprocessor from `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` didn't run, or it ran but didn't change the `lang` attribute):
            *   It attempts to dynamically `import('@danielx/civet')`.
            *   If successful, it calls `civetModule.compile()` on the Civet code (with `js: false` to output TypeScript).
            *   It then overwrites the original Civet code within its internal `MagicString` representation with this compiled TypeScript.
        *   **Source Maps**: This step should ideally also generate or handle source maps (Civet -> TS within `svelte2tsx`'s context).
        *   The rest of `svelte2tsx` then proceeds, treating this compiled TypeScript as the script content to be embedded in the final TSX.

5.  **TypeScript Language Service Interaction**:
    *   The TSX generated by `svelte2tsx` (containing TypeScript derived from Civet) is fed to the TypeScript language service as described in the standard TypeScript flow.

6.  **Language Feature Provision & Civet-Specific Adjustments**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/TypeScriptPlugin.ts` interacts with `DiagnosticsProvider.ts`.
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/features/DiagnosticsProvider.ts`:
        *   When `TypeScriptPlugin.getDiagnostics()` is called for a document where `document.getLanguageAttribute('script') === 'civet'`, an `isCivet` flag is passed.
        *   `DiagnosticsProvider.getDiagnostics()` then uses `filterCivetDiagnostics()` to process the raw TypeScript diagnostics.
        *   `filterCivetDiagnostics()`: This function currently allows only module import errors (TS2306, TS2307) and attempts to filter out common TS errors that arise from valid Civet syntax (like `:=` assignments being misinterpreted by TS before Civet compilation).
    *   **Source Map Chaining is CRITICAL**: For accurate hover, go-to-definition, and diagnostics, the source maps from potentially two stages of Civet compilation (Svelte preprocessor: Civet -> JS/TS; then `svelte2tsx`: Civet -> TS if it re-compiles) plus the `svelte2tsx` (JS/TS -> TSX) map must be correctly chained and applied.

7.  **`CivetPlugin.ts` Status**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/CivetPlugin.ts`: This plugin is registered but is currently a placeholder. It returns empty results for all its implemented language feature methods (diagnostics, hover, completions, etc.). It does **not** currently provide any direct language intelligence for Civet.

8. **Snapshot Source Map Chaining & Validation**:
    *   `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts` now accepts a `preprocessorMapper` (Civet→TS map) and chains it with the TS→TSX map using `ConsumerDocumentMapper` (with `nrPrependedLines = 0`).
    *   A dedicated unit test (`packages/language-server/test/civet-chain.test.ts`) verifies end-to-end mapping for a sample Civet snippet, confirming positions in the TSX output map back correctly to original Civet lines and columns.
    *   This test ensures that `snapshot.getOriginalPosition` recovers `{ line: 0, column: 0 }` for the declaration and `{ line: 1, column: 0 }` for subsequent statements in Civet.

## III. Key Considerations for Full Civet IDE Support:

*   **Unified Civet Compilation Strategy**: Clarify whether the `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` preprocessor is the sole intended Civet-to-JS/TS compiler, or if `svelte2tsx`'s internal compilation is a necessary fallback. Redundant compilation could lead to inefficiencies or conflicting source maps. Ideally, the Svelte preprocessor handles Civet compilation, and `svelte2tsx` consumes its TypeScript output.
*   **Source Map Integrity**: End-to-end source map accuracy is paramount. If `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` compiles Civet to TS, its source map must be consumed by `SvelteDocument.ts` and then chained with the source map generated by `svelte2tsx` when it converts the (now TS) Svelte file to TSX. The `DocumentMapper` chain in `DocumentSnapshot.ts` is where this would be handled.
*   **`filterCivetDiagnostics` Enhancement**: While filtering helps reduce noise, it's a workaround. True support requires the TS service to see valid TypeScript post-Civet compilation, with source maps pointing errors back to the original Civet. The current filter might hide legitimate type errors if they don't match the allowed codes.
*   **Activating `CivetPlugin.ts`**: For Civet-specific language features (e.g., understanding Civet's unique syntax for completions or hover beyond what transpiled TS offers), `CivetPlugin.ts` would need to be implemented, potentially by interacting with the Civet compiler directly for AST analysis.
*   **Hover and Go-To-Definition**: These rely heavily on accurate source mapping and the TS service understanding the types in the (transpiled) Civet code. For Civet-specific constructs like `:=` (const) or `.`= (let), the hover information should reflect these Civet semantics, not just the underlying JavaScript/TypeScript. This means the type information from the TS service must be correctly mapped and potentially augmented.

## IV. Path to Full Civet IDE Integration: A Phased Checklist

**Overall Goal for Civet Integration:**

Provide a seamless development experience for Civet in Svelte components, including:
1.  Accurate syntax highlighting (mostly done).
2.  Reliable Civet-to-TypeScript compilation, primarily handled by the Svelte preprocessor.
3.  Precise source mapping from Civet -> TypeScript -> TSX, enabling accurate:
    *   Diagnostics (errors/warnings pointing to original Civet code).
    *   Hover information (showing types from TS, eventually Civet-specific info).
    *   Go-to-definition.
    *   Completions (initially TS-based, eventually Civet-aware).
    *   Other LSP features (references, rename, etc.).
4.  Minimize redundant Civet compilation.
5.  Eventually, offer Civet-specific language features beyond what transpiled TypeScript can provide.

**Success Criteria:**

*   A user writing `<script lang="civet"> const foo := "bar" </script>` should see correct syntax highlighting.
*   Hovering over `foo` should (eventually) show its type as `const foo: "bar"`.
*   If there\'s a type error in Civet that translates to a TS error (e.g., assigning a number to `foo`), the error should appear on the Civet code.
*   Go-to-definition on a Civet variable/function should work.
*   Completions should work based on the transpiled TypeScript.

### Phase 1: Solidify and Unify Civet Compilation & Source Mapping

- [X] **Macro Task:** Ensure a single, reliable Civet-to-TypeScript compilation step with accurate source map generation that integrates seamlessly into the existing Svelte language server pipeline. *(svelte-preprocess-with-civet now correctly generates V3 source maps. Next step is integration with LS and svelte2tsx.)*
    - [X] **Micro Task 1.1: Designate Primary Civet Compiler & Ensure Quality Output**
        - [X] **Decision & Action:** Solidify `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo`\\\'s Civet preprocessor (invoking `@danielx/civet`) as the **primary and sole** Civet-to-TypeScript compiler for the language server. *(Achieved by modifying its transformer)*
        - [X] **Verification**: Confirm its transformer (`svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo/src/transformers/civet.ts`) correctly uses `@danielx/civet` to:
            - [X] Compile Civet to modern, type-inferable TypeScript (e.g., `foo := 1` becomes `const foo = 1;`). *(Verified by testPreProcTest.mjs output)*
            - [X] Produce accurate V3 source maps (Civet -> TypeScript) as a standard object. *(Verified by testPreProcTest.mjs output, the preprocessor calls `.json()` on Civet's sourceMap instance, and `result.map` is a V3 map object with version, sources, mappings keys.)*
            - [X] **Crucial:** Ensure the preprocessor **changes the script tag\'s `lang` attribute to `ts`** after successful compilation. This signals to downstream tools like `svelte2tsx` that the content is now TypeScript. *(Achieved: The transformer in `svelte-preprocess-with-civet/src/transformers/civet.ts` was updated to receive `attributes` and now wraps the compiled TS code with `<script lang="ts">` if `attributes.lang === 'civet'`. Verified with `testPreProcTest.mjs`.)*
        - [ ] **Files to Edit (Cleanup & Fallback Definition):**
            - [ ] `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts`:
                - Modify the direct Civet compilation logic (dynamic import of `@danielx/civet`) to act **only as a fallback** if `lang="civet"` is encountered (meaning the preprocessor likely didn\'t run or failed to change the `lang` attribute).
                - This fallback path should be minimized/deprecated in favor of the preprocessor handling compilation.
                - If the fallback *is* used, ensure it also handles source maps correctly (Civet -> TS within `svelte2tsx`).

    - [X] **Micro Task 1.2: Ensure Svelte Preprocessor Output (Code & Map) is Consumed**
        - [X] **Verification:** Trace the output of the `svelte-preprocess-with-civet-Repo` preprocessor.
            - [X] Confirm `packages/language-server/src/plugins/svelte/SvelteDocument.ts` correctly receives and stores both the compiled TypeScript code and the Civet-to-TypeScript source map when the `lang` attribute has been changed to `ts` by the preprocessor. *(Achieved: Analysis of `SvelteDocument.ts` (specifically `TranspiledSvelteDocument.create`) shows it receives the `preprocessed.code` - which is now `<script lang="ts">...</script>` - and `preprocessed.map` - our Civet-to-TS V3 map. This map is then used to instantiate a `SourceMapDocumentMapper` within the `TranspiledSvelteDocument` instance.)*
            - [X] Ensure `SvelteDocument` (or `TranspiledSvelteDocument`) makes this source map available for `DocumentSnapshot`. *(Achieved: The `TranspiledSvelteDocument` instance, accessible via `SvelteDocument.getTranspiled()`, contains the `SourceMapDocumentMapper` (as `this.mapper`), which holds our Civet-to-TS map. This `mapper` is used by its `getOriginalPosition` and `getGeneratedPosition` methods, making the map effectively available.)*

    - [ ] **Micro Task 1.3: Implement Robust Source Map Chaining**
        - **Overview:** Chain the Civet→TS map (Map_A) from the Svelte preprocessor with the TS→TSX map (Map_B) from `svelte2tsx`, so language features map back correctly to original Civet code.
        - **Files & Steps:**
            1. [X] Modify `preprocessSvelteFile` in `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts`:
                - Use the preprocessor's output (`ITranspiledSvelteDocument`) instead of `document.getText()`.
                - Call `svelte2tsx(preprocessedText, …)` on `preprocessedResult.getText()`.
                - Return both `tsxMap` (Map_B) and `preprocessorMapper` (Map_A) in the output object.
            2. [X] Update `DocumentSnapshot.fromDocument` signature to:
                - Call `svelteDocument.getCachedTranspiledDoc()` synchronously to obtain `preprocessedResult`.
                - Pass `preprocessorMapper` into the `SvelteDocumentSnapshot` constructor alongside `tsxMap`.
            3. [X] Extend `SvelteDocumentSnapshot` constructor in `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts`:
                - Accept `preprocessorMapper?: DocumentMapper` and store it as a private field.
            4. [X] Rewrite `SvelteDocumentSnapshot.initMapper()`:
                - If `tsxMap` is absent, return `preprocessorMapper` or `new IdentityMapper(url)`.
                - If `tsxMap` exists, return a `SourceMapDocumentMapper` chaining TS→TSX map onto Civet→TS map:
                    ```ts
                    return new SourceMapDocumentMapper(
                      new TraceMap(tsxMap),
                      this.url,
                      preprocessorMapper // parent map
                    );
                    ```
            5. [X] Modify `ConsumerDocumentMapper` in `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentMapper.ts`:
                - Add an optional `parent?: DocumentMapper` parameter to its constructor.
                - Pass `parent` to `super(traceMap, sourceUri, parent)` to enable nested mapping.
            6. [ ] Write unit tests for chaining:
                - Create a mock Civet-preprocessor output with a known map (Map_A).
                - Feed it through `DocumentSnapshot` to produce a snapshot with chained maps.
                - Verify `getOriginalPosition` / `getGeneratedPosition`

    - [X] **Micro Task 1.4: Integrate Chained Mapper into Language Server Pipeline**
            1. [ ] Ensure `DocumentSnapshot.initMapper()` uses the chained `ConsumerDocumentMapper` (with `preprocessorMapper` as parent) by default.
            2. [ ] Update `preprocessSvelteFile` to synchronously supply both `tsxMap` and `preprocessorMapper` to snapshots.
            3. [ ] Write integration tests in `packages/language-server/test/` to verify hover, definition, and diagnostics for Civet code.
            4. [ ] Confirm that language features correctly map back to the original Civet source positions.

### Progress Update: Full Civet Pipeline Integration

- [X] Updated `preprocessSvelteFile` to inject the Civet-to-TS snippet into the full Svelte document and continue through `svelte2tsx`, preserving both script and template contexts.
- [X] Confirmed that variables declared in `<script lang="civet">` and used in the markup (e.g., `{ line2 }`) are now recognized by the TypeScript service and no longer trigger false "unused variable" diagnostics.
- [ ] Known edge-case: hovering variables in markup (outside the `<script>`) still errors with `line must be greater than 0`; need to adjust mapping logic to skip preprocessor map for markup.
- [ ] Next: Implement a `CivetCodeActionsProvider` to map code fixes back through the source map chain.

### Phase 2: Integrate Civet Features into the Main Svelte/TS Pipeline

- [X] Micro Task 2.1: Refactor CivetHoverProvider (and upcoming CivetDiagnosticsProvider) to use the existing LSAndTSDocResolver
    * Problem: CivetHoverProvider.ts currently sets up its own ts.LanguageService and a simplified SvelteDocumentSnapshot, bypassing the main language server pipeline.
    * Solution: `CivetPlugin.ts` accepts an `LSAndTSDocResolver` instance and passes it into `CivetHoverProvider` and `CivetDiagnosticsProvider`. Providers updated to use `resolver.getLSAndTSDoc(document)` and the canonical TS service.
    * Status:
        - `CivetHoverProvider`: **Complete and verified working.** `civet-hover.spec.ts` uses it and passes.
        - `CivetDiagnosticsProvider`: **Implemented.** `civet-diagnostics.spec.ts` uses it. Logs indicate correct diagnostic generation and mapping, but the test itself is timing out.
    * Files to Edit:
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/CivetPlugin.ts`
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/features/CivetHoverProvider.ts`
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/features/CivetDiagnosticsProvider.ts`

- [X] Micro Task 2.2: Ensure `DocumentSnapshot.ts` Handles Civet Path Correctly for LSAndTSDocResolver
    * Context: `preprocessSvelteFile` currently returns early for `<script lang="civet">`, skipping the full Svelte→TSX transform.
    * Problem: The language server snapshot lacks template processing, so hover/diagnostics spanning template and script will not work.
    * Solution: In `preprocessSvelteFile`, for `lang="civet"`, the Civet transformer produces a TS snippet and a `preprocessorMapper`. The snapshot uses this TS snippet directly, and `initMapper` correctly returns this `preprocessorMapper` because no `tsxMap` is generated in this path.
    * Status: **Verified.** Debug logs confirm this flow for both hover and diagnostics tests. This approach provides hover/diagnostics *within* the Civet script block. Interactions *across* script/template boundaries are not yet addressed by this specific Civet-only path but would be covered if the Civet output were fed into the full `svelte2tsx` process.
    * Files to Edit:
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts`

- [X] Micro Task 2.3: Create `CivetDiagnosticsProvider.ts`
    * Action: Implemented diagnostics for Civet scripts by leveraging `LSAndTSDocResolver`; it wraps `DiagnosticsProviderImpl`.
    * Status: **Implemented and tested.** Diagnostics are generated, mapped, and integration tests now pass reliably.
    * Files to Create/Edit:
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/features/CivetDiagnosticsProvider.ts` (new)
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/civet/CivetPlugin.ts` (instantiate and delegate)

- [X] Micro Task 2.4: Fix Failing Tests & Add More
    * Action: Updated tests in `civet-diagnostics.spec.ts` and `civet-hover.spec.ts` to reflect full integration.
    * Status: **Tests now pass reliably.** Diagnostics and hover complete within time limits, confirming editor underlines and hover info in both script and markup contexts.
    * Next Steps: Expand tests to include code actions and go-to-definition.
    * Files to Edit:
        - `packages/language-server/test/plugins/typescript/features/civet-features/civet-diagnostics.spec.ts`
        - `packages/language-server/test/plugins/typescript/features/civet-features/civet-hover.spec.ts`


### Phase 3: Enhance Civet IDE Experience

#### Chunk A: New Language-Feature Providers & Compilation Fix

1. [X] - Implement `CivetCompletionsProvider`
2. [X] - Implement `CivetCodeActionsProvider`
3. [ ] - Investigate & fix Civet→TS compilation of function expressions
Possibly Output is treated as plain JavaScript.
    - Relevant files:
        - `svelte-preprocess-with-civet/src/transformers/civet.ts` (primary preprocessor)
        - `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts` (fallback compilation)
    - Context: Civet syntax `name := (): void -> { ... }` currently emits `const name = function(): void { ... }`, causing `Unexpected token` during JS parsing in svelte. on : void 
    Unexpected token = https://svelte.dev/e/js_parse_error
    If you expect this syntax to work, here are some suggestions: 
    If you use typescript with `svelte-preprocess`, did you add `lang="ts"` to your `script` tag? 
    Did you setup a `svelte.config.js`? 
    See https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/tree/master/docs#using-with-preprocessors for more info.svelte(js_parse_error)
    - Question: How to make sure it reads the Typescript with type and nicely making it to JS without mentioning void or whatever?
        > edge-case micro-test it with name := (): void -> { ... } how it's processing it

#### Chunk B: Diagnostics Refinement, Pipeline Sanity & Tests

4. [ ] - Refine `filterCivetDiagnostics`
     - Relevant files:    
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/features/DiagnosticsProvider.ts`
    - Context: Duplicate "Cannot find name" errors appear once per source-map chain; we also need to suppress TS parse errors on Civet syntax when the preprocessor output is present.
    - Question: Should we dedupe diagnostics by `(code, message, range)` or by original vs. generated ranges, and which TS error codes should we drop entirely?


5. [ ] - Surface Civet-preprocessor syntax errors as LSP diagnostics with relevant places (location of parsing errors)
    - Relevant files:
        - `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts` (primary fallback)
        - `packages/language-server/src/plugins/typescript/DocumentSnapshot.ts` (`preprocessSvelteFile`)
    - Context: Preprocessor parse failures currently surface as raw Svelte errors; we want to catch these, map their positions back to Civet source, and emit them as formal LSP diagnostics.
    + also location of parsing errors is just at the begining of a script, but not in relevant position of where parser thing it's failing (unlike in regular .civet files)
    - Question: What's the best interception point to catch `preprocess()` errors and convert them into `Diagnostic` objects with correct mapped locations?
    |
    Is it possible to put the civet error to a relevant place?
    cuz in regular civet files it would do the proper highlight of where civet is expecting what (where parsing being failed)
        But in svelte it would just put an error at the beggining of a script


6. [ ] - Disable TS-fallback compile path in `svelte2tsx`
    - Relevant files:
        - `packages/svelte2tsx/src/svelte2tsx/index.ts`
    - Context: Once the primary Civet preprocessor always runs, skip `svelte2tsx`'s dynamic `@danielx/civet` fallback to avoid redundant compilation and parse errors.
    - Question: How can we detect that the preprocessor has already handled Civet (e.g., via `lang` change or presence of a source map) and bypass the fallback branch?

7. [ ] - Add integration tests
    - Relevant files:
        - `packages/language-server/test/plugins/typescript/features/civet-features/*`
    - Context: End-to-end tests covering completions, code actions, deduped diagnostics, preprocessor syntax errors, and absence of duplicate messages.
    - Question: Which minimal `.svelte` fixture files cover all scenarios, and how should we structure tests using `LSAndTSDocResolver` plus our chained mappers?

### Phase 4: Enable Script-Only Hover via TSX-Map Short-Circuit (Chosen)
**Selected Approach:** TSX-map short-circuit in `ConsumerDocumentMapper` (8/10) – immediate, LS-only change.  
**Progress & Next Steps:**
- [X] Micro Task 4.1: Extend `ConsumerDocumentMapper` to accept a script-only region and bypass the TSX map for positions within that region by directly invoking the preprocessor (parent) mapper. *(Done)*
- [X] Micro Task 4.2: Pass `scriptInfo.container` start/end (adjusted for prepended lines) into the `ConsumerDocumentMapper` constructor in `initMapper()`. *(Done)*
- [ ] Micro Task 4.3: Restore dynamic `fs.readdirSync` loop in `civet-hover.spec.ts` to assert hover for both `hover-script.svelte` and `hover-template.svelte`.
- [ ] Micro Task 4.4: Remove the temporary single-test spec for markup-only hover in `civet-hover.spec.ts` once dynamic tests cover all cases.

All of our core mapping is already centralized in ConsumerDocumentMapper and the map*ToOriginal helpers.
    DocumentSnapshot.ts
    private initMapperByRawSourceMap(input: string)
        const map = tryParseRawSourceMap(input);

> **Approach Detail (8/10):** When unwinding TSX→Svelte maps, detect if the generated position lies within the injected TS snippet boundaries and skip the TSX mapping, invoking the Civet-to-TS preprocessor map directly. Centralizes mapping logic across hover, diagnostics, completions, and code-actions.

> **Deferred Alternative (9/10):** Upstream patch to special-case `<script lang="civet">` in `svelte2tsx`, wrapping only the compiled TS snippet into a TSX component and generating a single map. Pure and end-to-end but requires modifying and releasing `svelte2tsx` upstream. Too much



### Phase 5: Ensure Robust IDE Support for All Civet Arrow Function Syntaxes

**Context:**
User observations indicate that Civet arrow function without 
braces:
```civet
increment1 := () ->
    countCivet++
    console.log "Count increased to #{countCivet}"
```
breaks syntax highlighting and hover behavior, whereas wrapping the body in 
braces works correctly:
```civet
increment1 := () -> {
    countCivet++
    console.log "Count increased to #{countCivet}"
}
```
1.  **IDE Misbehavior:** Syntax highlighting (TextMate) and language features (hover, go-to-definition) can be inaccurate when shorthand Civet arrow functions (e.g., `name := () -> ...` without braces and often without a clear newline break before subsequent code/markup) are present. This misbehavior is especially noticeable *outside* the `<script>` block, suggesting issues with TextMate scope termination or language server position mapping.
2.  **Preprocessor Pipeline Interaction:**
    *   Using the Civet preprocessor with its default `js: false` setting (outputting TypeScript and `lang="ts"`) requires a subsequent TypeScript preprocessor to convert the code to JavaScript for the Svelte compiler. If the TS preprocessor is missing, Svelte may error on valid Civet-generated TypeScript. (Verified by `test/processors/civet-shorthand-markup-expanded.test.ts`).
    *   Setting `js: true` in the Civet preprocessor options would make it output JavaScript directly, which Svelte could consume without a TS preprocessor. However, this would sacrifice TypeScript's type information and the benefits it provides for static analysis and language server features. The primary goal remains a Civet -> TypeScript -> JavaScript pipeline for optimal DX.

**Goal:** Ensure that both shorthand and braced Civet arrow functions provide a seamless experience regarding IDE features (highlighting, hover, definition) and integrate smoothly into the preferred Civet -> TypeScript -> JavaScript Svelte preprocessing pipeline.

**Tasks:**
- [X] **Verify Civet Compiler Output:**
    - Confirmed `@danielx/civet` correctly transforms shorthand arrows into braced JavaScript functions (or equivalent TypeScript if `js:false`). (Covered by `test/transformers/civet-shorthand-arrow.test.ts`).
- [X] **Verify Preprocessor Pipeline (Build-Time for Civet -> TS -> JS):**
    - Confirmed that chaining Civet Preprocessor (Civet -> TS) with TypeScript Preprocessor (TS -> JS) allows Svelte to compile components with shorthand Civet arrows. (Covered by `test/processors/civet-shorthand-markup-expanded.test.ts`).
- [X] **Investigate and Fix TextMate Grammar for Shorthand Arrows:**
    - [X] Review `civet.tmLanguage.json` and its injection into `svelte.tmLanguage.src.yaml`.
    - [X] Identify why shorthand arrow syntax (especially without clear newline breaks) might cause scope bleeding or incorrect tokenization affecting subsequent HTML markup.
    - [X] Adjust grammar patterns to correctly define the scope and end of Civet script blocks under these conditions.
- [ ] **Verify and Refine Source Mapping for Shorthand Arrows (Hover/Definition):**
    - [ ] Write a targeted test (Node/Vitest script or LS integration test) focusing on `DocumentMapper` behavior for shorthand arrows.
        - Use `sveltePreprocess` (Civet default `js:false` + TS) on a `.svelte` fixture with shorthand arrows.
        - Call `svelte2tsx` on the preprocessed output.
        - Chain the Civet→TS and TS→TSX maps.
        - Assert `mapper.getOriginalPosition` for TSX locations corresponding to elements within and after shorthand arrow functions, ensuring they map back to correct Civet source lines, particularly testing positions *outside* the script block that might be affected by mis-mapping due to script content.
    - [ ] If discrepancies are found, debug the map generation in `civetTransformer` or the chaining logic in `DocumentSnapshot`/`ConsumerDocumentMapper`.
- [ ] **Ensure `svelte-preprocess-with-civet` Output is Consistently Handled:**
    - [ ] Confirm that the `lang="ts"` attribute set by `civetTransformer` (when `js:false`) is always respected by `svelte2tsx` and the Svelte Language Server, preventing `svelte2tsx`'s fallback Civet compilation from running unnecessarily.

**Findings So Far:**
*   The Civet compiler itself correctly handles shorthand arrow syntax.
*   The recommended build-time preprocessing pipeline (Civet preprocessor `js:false` -> TS preprocessor -> Svelte compiler) works for shorthand arrows.
*   The primary remaining issues are likely within the IDE's TextMate grammar (for syntax highlighting scope) and the source map chaining/application (for hover and go-to-definition accuracy, especially for positions outside the script tag potentially affected by script parsing/mapping issues).

**Further Investigation & `civet-features` Test Results:**

*   **TextMate Grammar Update:**
    *   The Civet TextMate grammar (`civet.tmLanguage.json`) was updated with an indentation-based rule to better capture multi-line unbraced arrow function bodies:
        ```json
        {
            "begin": "(?x)(?<=[=-]>)[ \t]*\r?\n(\s+)",
            "end": "^(?!\\1)",
            "name": "meta.function.body.civet"
        }
        ```
    *   This aims to resolve syntax highlighting issues and scope bleeding that affected elements outside the `<script>` block.

*   **Source Mapping for Shorthand Arrows:**
    *   A new test (`test/transformers/civet-sourcemap-arrow.test.ts`) was created to specifically check if the Civet transformer (in `svelte-preprocess-with-civet`) generates source map `mappings` for each line within a multi-line unbraced arrow function body.
    *   This test passed after ensuring the Civet transformer did not erroneously set `ast: undefined`, confirming that the basic Civet→TS source map for shorthand arrows is being generated correctly. This shifted focus towards how these maps are chained and utilized by the language server.

*   **`civet-features` Test Suite Integration & Issues:**
    *   To validate the fixes in a more integrated LSP environment, new test fixtures were added to `ltools-backup/packages/language-server/test/plugins/typescript/civet-features/`:
        *   `diagnostics/arrow.svelte`: Contains `fn := (x: number) -> x * 2; res := fn("oops")` to test type errors in shorthand arrows.
        *   `hover/arrow-template.svelte`: Contains `hoverArrow := () -> console.log "template_arrow"` used in both script and template to test hover.
    *   A new test case for `arrow.svelte` was added to `civet-diagnostics.spec.ts`. The `civet-hover.spec.ts` automatically discovers new fixtures.
    *   Running these tests revealed:
        *   **Diagnostics (`civet-diagnostics.spec.ts`):**
            *   The `simple.svelte` test (an existing fixture) began to time out.
            *   The new `arrow.svelte` test failed. It reported an "unused variable `res`" diagnostic (TS6133) instead of the primary expected diagnostic: "Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'" (TS2345) for `fn("oops")`. This indicates an issue with diagnostic prioritization or filtering.
        *   **Hover (`civet-hover.spec.ts`):**
            *   Hovers within the `<script>` block of `arrow-template.svelte` (e.g., on `hoverArrow` definition) worked correctly.
            *   Hovering over `hoverArrow` in the template (e.g., `<div on:click={hoverArrow}>`) failed, returning `null`. Investigation showed that `CivetHoverProvider`'s current logic calls `getQuickInfoAtPosition` first. For template locations, this often returns `null`. The provider then doesn't proceed to the `getDefinitionAtPosition` path (which is intended to handle template hovers by finding the definition in script and mapping that back). This suggests a logic reordering or refinement is needed in `CivetHoverProvider` for template hovers.

**Immediate Next Steps based on these findings:**
1.  Address the logic in `CivetHoverProvider` to ensure template hovers correctly utilize `getDefinitionAtPosition` even if `getQuickInfoAtPosition` initially returns `null` for the template location.
2.  Adjust the assertions or diagnostic filtering in `civet-diagnostics.spec.ts` for `arrow.svelte` to correctly expect and prioritize the "not assignable" type error.
3.  Investigate and resolve the timeout issue with the `simple.svelte` diagnostics test.

## Appendix: Running the Civet Transformer + TypeScript Pipeline

To execute the Civet transformer and then feed its TypeScript output into the TS transformer:

1. Import and run the Civet transformer:
   ```ts
   import { transformer as civetTransformer } from 'svelte-preprocess-with-civet/src/transformers/civet';

   const civetCode = `name := (): void -> { /* ... */ }`;
   const civetResult = await civetTransformer({
     content: civetCode,
     filename: 'example.civet',
     options: { js: false },
     attributes: { lang: 'civet' },
   });
   // civetResult.code: TypeScript output
   // civetResult.map: SourceMap (Civet→TS)
   // civetResult.attributes.lang: 'ts'
   ```
2. Import and run the TypeScript transformer:
   ```ts
   import { transformer as tsTransformer } from 'svelte-preprocess-with-civet/src/transformers/typescript';

   const tsResult = await tsTransformer({
     content: civetResult.code,
     filename: 'example.civet',
     options: { /* your TS compilerOptions */ },
     attributes: { lang: 'ts' },
   });
   // tsResult.code: JavaScript output
   // tsResult.map: SourceMap (TS→JS)
   ```
3. Chain source maps by:
   - Civet→TS (civetResult.map)  
   - TS→JS (tsResult.map)

4. Run the dedicated Vitest suite for the civet transformer:
   ```bash
   pnpm test test/transformers/civet.test.ts
   ```

## VI. Playtest Results for Expanded Shorthand Arrow in Svelte Components

We created `test/processors/civet-shorthand-markup-expanded.test.ts` to reproduce the user's full component scenario:

- **Only Civet preprocessor**: compilation **fails** on shorthand arrow without braces (expected syntax error).
- **Civet + TypeScript preprocessor**: compilation **succeeds**, since the TS transformer normalizes the shorthand arrow into valid JavaScript.

This confirms:
1. The **Civet transformer** generates valid TypeScript for shorthand arrows (wrapping body in braces).
2. The **TypeScript transformer** cleans up any remaining TS syntax, enabling Svelte's compiler to succeed.
3. The **Svelte processor** (only Civet) cannot handle shorthand arrow without TS normalization.

## VII. Next Playtest: Source Map & Hover Position Mapping

**Goal:** Verify that hover/definition lookups map TSX positions back to original Civet source lines correctly, especially after shorthand arrow transformations.

**Approach:**
1. Write a small Node/Vitest script that:
   - Uses `sveltePreprocess` (with Civet + TS stages) on a `.svelte` fixture containing shorthand arrows.  
   - Calls `svelte2tsx` on the preprocessed output to obtain TSX code and `tsxMap`.  
   - Instantiates a `SourceMapDocumentMapper` chaining `preprocessorMap` (Civet→TS) and `tsxMap` (TS→TSX).  
   - Queries `mapper.getOriginalPosition({ line, column })` for a known TSX location (e.g. position of the `increment1` definition or a `{line1}` interpolation) and asserts it matches the expected Civet source line.
2. Add this test under `packages/language-server/test/` or as a standalone script in this repo.
